A bold jekyll theme built for gaitQ. Designed to have two distinct styling, depending on current URL.

## Jekyll Theme Scaffolding

How this repo is organised and what the various files are. All posts, layouts, includes, stylesheets, assets, and whatever else is grouped  under the root folder. The compiled Jekyll site outputs to `_site/`, which is never pushed to this repo, see https://www.gaitq.madeslowly.xyz/. General flow starts with a `.md` file in our root. With Front Matter, we declare our layout which points to a structural `.html` file in `_layouts`. From here, the layout file can call in data from our `_config.yml` with `{{ site.variable }}` and from any of our `YAML` files in `_data/file.yml` with `{{ site.data.file.variable }}`. The layout can also pull in other structural html snippets from `_includes` with `{% raw %}{% include relative/path/file.html %}{% endraw %}`.

It is worth noting that _include files can also perform the tasks just described. So, for example, when the `deafult.html` layout is executed (the penultimate step for *all* `.md` files), the `head.html` snippet is called, which in turn calls `og-meta.html`. Based on our sites settings and any relevant Front Matter belonging to the calling file, `og-meta.html` compiles all our `og:meta` tags and passes them to `head.html` which after adding further code, passes on to our default layout where it is placed at the top of our webpages `html`.

### Site Wide Configuration

`_config.yml` is where most variables are set.

#### `title:`

The global title of the website.

#### `subtitle:`

The global subtitle of the website.

#### Page Titling

Each pages is given a title according to,

```Liquid
{% if page.title %}
  {{ page.title }} | {{ site.title }}
{% else %}
  {{ site.title }} | {{ site.subtitle }}
{% endif %}
```

#### `description:`

Site wide description, used in head description, og:description, twitter:description and structured data. Overwritten by page front matter, `description:`

#### `url:`

Used to generate absolute URLs for sitemaps, feeds and for generating canonical URLs in a page's `<head>`. When developing locally either comment this out or use something like `http://localhost:4000` so all assets load properly. *Don't include a trailing `/`*.

Examples:

```yaml
url: "https://gaitq.github.io"
url: "http://localhost:4000"
url: "http://www.gaitq.com"
url: ""
```

#### `baseurl:`

Used when we are developing a partial.

#### `author:`

Author of this Jekyll project. Content authors can be added to _data/authors.yml and assigned in a pages front matter.

#### `postal_add:`

Postal address of GaitQ Ltd. Used in structured data.

#### `opening_hours:`

Used in structured data. This lets google know when we are open.

#### `logo:`

Site wide logo, used as a default image for Twitter and Facebook. Can be over written by a pages front matter: `image:`.

#### Google Analytics and Webmaster Tools

Google Analytics UA and Webmaster Tool verification tags can be entered under `owner` in `_config.yml`. For more information on obtaining these meta tags check [Google Webmaster Tools](http://support.google.com/webmasters/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=35179) and [Bing Webmaster Tools](https://ssl.bing.com/webmaster/configure/verify/ownership) support.

### Navigation Links

To set what links appear in the top navigation edit `_data/menu.yml`. Use the following format to set the URL and title for as many links as you'd like.

```yaml
group_name:
  - name:  Page name
    url:   /pageURL.html
    env:   environment
    submenu:
      - name: Page name
        url:  /pageURL.html
```

We for loop  `group_name` = `navigation`. The `env:` controls where and how we see the navigation link and it's submenu contents. Currently we have three allowable `envs:`, `gaitq`, `data` and `patients`.
